This repository contains additional resources about my undergraduate research experiences in the folder "Undergrad_Research". 

Within "Undergrad_Research" you will find 3 folders related to different undergraduate research experiences and some papers, presentations, and additional resources for each experience. 

## "REU_Research"
This folder contains a pdf file of a scientific paper I wrote examining the spatial and temporal behavior of collared peccaries. This study was conducted in the summer of 2018 during my time in a REU program at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. 

## "Study_Abroad_Research"
This folder contains a PowerPoint presentation file of a study I conducted examining the effects of light exposure on plant morphology. This study was conducted in the summer of 2019 during my time studying abroad in Panama. 

## "Undergrad_Lab_Research"
This folder contains a R script file, a pdf file of a scientific paper, and a PowerPoint presentation file of the research. 
These files are from a study I conducted in 2019, during my last few semesters in undergrad as a member of a plant ecology lab, where I examined the effects of plant associations and individual traits on neighboring Arthropod community dynamics.
